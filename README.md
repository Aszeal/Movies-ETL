***Amazing Prime***


*Overview*

I was assigned a project by Britta(Amazing Prime Empoyee) to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. I refactored their code to create one function that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.

Below is a screenshot of the Movies_Metadata as a result of the csv file being to large to import.
